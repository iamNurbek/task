# Todo List Project

## Overview

The Todo List project is a simple command-line application built in Java. It allows users to manage tasks effectively by adding, viewing, and marking tasks as completed. The project is designed to demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, and basic user input handling using the Scanner class.

This project serves as my first step into learning Java. I find Java to be an intriguing and powerful language, and this project has given me hands-on experience with its syntax and structure. While this is a basic implementation, it lays the groundwork for more complex and advanced projects that I plan to develop in the future.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with descriptions.
- **View Tasks**: Displays a list of all tasks along with their completion status.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Allows users to mark tasks as finished.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code

## Learning Journey

This project marks the beginning of my journey into Java programming. Through building this application, I have learned:

- How to use Javaâ€™s Scanner class for user input.
- The basics of object-oriented programming by creating and managing a `Task` class.
- How to use ArrayLists to store and manipulate data dynamically.

## Future Plans

I am excited to expand on this project or create more advanced ones. Some ideas for improvement or future features include:

- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
- Implementing task prioritization and deadlines.
- Storing tasks persistently using file handling or a database.
